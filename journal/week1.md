# Week 1 â€” App Containerization
Required Home work for week1 Journal
This section was a bit challenging for me as I am learning how to use docker and app contenarization, but I am having  a lot of fun and still working/rebuilding this section of learning.
1) I was able to configure docker compose and bring the front end and the backend containers up.

Some of the highlights from week1 learning are:

Installing dependecies such as "npm i" before running "docker compse up"

npm install packages (or npm i) - well, what does "npm i" do?

"This command installs a package and any packages that it depends on. If the package has a package-lock, or an npm shrinkwrap file, or a yarn lock file, the installation of dependencies will be driven by that, respecting the following order of precedence"
https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-install

Installed DynamoDB and Postgress
I created another docker-compose file at the root of the AWSS-BOOTCAMP-CRUDDUR-2023
