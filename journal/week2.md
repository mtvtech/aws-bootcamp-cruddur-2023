2) Configure OpenTelemetry to send events to Honeycomb using environment variables.

Add:

export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://api.honeycomb.io/"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="x-honeycomb-team=your-api-key"
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="your-service-name"
python app.py tracing.py


3) Install these dependencies from backend-flask directory:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Verify that the requirements.txt file has the following codes:

opentelemetry-api 
opentelemetry-sdk 
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http 
opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask 
opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests

4) Makesure to export the necssary 

export ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN="***********"
gp env ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN="***********"
