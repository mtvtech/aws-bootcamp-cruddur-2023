# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

This section of AWS bootcamp introduces the concept of observability when it comes to systems. It tells a story about your application. This is also know as distributing tracing. This part of bootcamp also introduce hands on practice on a platforms such as Honeycomb AWSS X-Ray and Cloudwtach.

What is Instrumentation ?
Instrumentation is the code that collect and send the data to a platform such as Hineycomb that makes the trace.

What is span?
A span is a part of a trace that describes a certain unit of work . A trace has a start, an end and a duration.

Example of a trace. It shows a span, duration and selected properties.

Configuring Honeycomb.io

OprnTelementry for python docs - 
https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-data-in/opentelemetry/python/

1) Create Honetcomb account

2) Configure OpenTelemetry to send events to Honeycomb using environmental variables.

Add:

3) Install these dependencies from backend-flask directory:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    "Verify that the requirements.txt file has the following code"

6) After making sure the front and backend flask applications are up you can generate traces by reloading the browser.

7) Displaying metrics generated from Honeycomb instrumentation

Cloudwatch

I was to configure AWS Cloudwatch and complete only the first part. The Span part broke my code and have a plan to come back and complete the 2nd part.

1st added  "watchtower" in the  requirments.txt file and run pip install from the "backend-flask" directory.

2nd Configured docker-compose.yml and include the following environment variables.

Rollbar

"Rollbar is a a cloud-based bug tracking and monitoring soluation."

In this section you can see that a code of removed from the baceknd and that generated an error which was reported to Rollbar.

1st created a Rollbar free account and selected "flask" as a framework.. 

2nd Added  "blinker and rollbar" in the  requirments.txt file and run pip install from the "backend-flask" directory.

3rd configured app.py and two block of code:

Showing Rollbar "Hello World" test:
